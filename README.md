# Joy-CAD
Recreations of the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons created with Fusion360
## Why?
I created this repo as I found that there were close to no models of the Joy-Con's shells available.
These models are for those who intend to 3D Print their own Joy-Con shells, or for any who want to create models off of the existing shells.
## Contribution?
These models are by no means perfect. I would encourage any and all with more experience with CAD to improve the accuracy, functionality, and efficiency of these models.
The submission of 3D scanned models, accurate measurements, and modifications to existing models are all greatly appreciated.
## Problems?
There are quite a few issues with these models.
- D-Pad Indents are very hacky, and do not print well at all.
- Nothing has been verified to work yet, and therefore may not fit.
- The .STEP file is messy.
## Where's the rest of it?
Not all of the Joy-Con shells have been modeled yet, but they are coming soon.
## Snap-Together?
Several times, when I was putting together 3D-Printed shells, some way or another, the screws have bound too tightly, and had become impossible to remove. This is extremely dangerous for an inexperienced Switch modder. Any parts that have broken due to an incorrect assembly are now impossible to repair without tearing the Joy-Con apart, which may cause wires to be cut and unrepairable, or worse, the battery to explode, which may cause serious harm. A snap-together joy-con will solve all of these problems, in addition to allowing an easier repair cycle if a component breaks.
