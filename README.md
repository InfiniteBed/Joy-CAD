# Joy-CAD

Recreations of the Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons created with Fusion360.

## Purpose
I created this repository because I noticed a lack of available models for the Joy-Con's shells. These models are intended for individuals who want to 3D print their own Joy-Con shells or create new models based on existing ones.

## Contribution
These models are not perfect, and I welcome contributions from anyone with CAD experience to improve their accuracy, functionality, and efficiency. I would greatly appreciate the submission of 3D scanned models, accurate measurements, and modifications to existing models.

## Known Issues
There are several problems with these models:

- The models have not been completed verified to work, so they may not fit correctly.
- The .STEP file is messy.

## Work in Progress
Not all of the Joy-Con shells have been modeled yet, but they will be added soon.

## Snap-Together Design
During the assembly of 3D-printed shells, screws can sometimes become tightly bound, making them impossible to remove. This poses a serious risk, especially for inexperienced Switch modders. If a part breaks due to incorrect assembly, it becomes difficult to repair without damaging the Joy-Con, potentially cutting wires or causing the battery to explode. To address these issues and simplify the repair process, a snap-together Joy-Con design is being developed.
